bash has command completion, command history, search in history features.
# To complete command, Tab button is used.
# To display command history, up/down arrow buttons or Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N keystrokes are used.
# To search any command in history, Ctrl+R keystroke helps.
# To go to begin or end of a long command, Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E keystrokes are preferred.
  Sometimes, left/right arrow or Ctrl+B and Ctrl+F keystrokes are used to go forward or
  backward one character. Some of these features were moved after Emacs editor was released.
# Ctrl+D keystroke works as delete button.
# Ctrl+K deletes all characters after cursor position in like Emacs.
# Ctrl+T transposes character before cursor with character under cursor.
# U, L and C button after ESC are used for uppercase, lowercase. ESC, then U converts all 
  characters uppercase, meanwhile L converts all lowercase. C converts only character under
  cursor uppercase.
# Ctrl+X, then Ctrl+E starts default editor which is defined with $FCEDIT or $EDITOR.

Shell Configuration
-------------------
~/.bashrc, ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile files are user configuration files of bash.
/etc/bashrc and /etc/profile files are global configuration files as well.

Environment Variables
---------------------
Environment variables are shell variables. They can be defined implicitly and explicitly.
export command is used to define any variable explicitly.

export EDITOR=/opt/local/bin/emacs

The configuration files may be used to define EDITOR environment variables. The above 
command is added inside configuration file, so in each startup, the command is run and
EDITOR environment variable set as emacs.

env command prints all environment variables of system.
