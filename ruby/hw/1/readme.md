this program matches a pattern to a sting.
the critical points are chomp, ord and regex.

-> chomp trim new line character from string.
-> ord function returns ASCII integer value of a character
-> the /[A-Za-z]/ or /[0-9]/ regex's are performed with =~ operator
   and scan if character is in the range.
