### Optimization Algorithms<br>
This project is an example implementation project that includes some optimization algorithm implementations. It can be used to demonstrate how the algorithms work. There are seven different optimization methods:
 - Simplex Method Algorithm
 - Branch & Bound Algorithm
 - Newton-Raphson Algorithm
 - Discrete Programming Algorithm
 - Direct Search Method
 - Gradient Method
 - Linear Combinations Method

It shows a menu for the user on command line, so you don't need any graphical interface dependency. However, the algorithms use __sympy__, __scipy__ module for equation and matrix operations. All algorithms take own input parameters via csv file, which include coefficients of equaitons defining the problem. These coefficients belong to objective and constraint functions.
